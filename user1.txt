Work ethics is the ability of an employee to be reliable and trustworthy. Reliability is base on an employeeâ€™s presence and efficiency in doing what they agreed upon hire, be it job-related or not. Trustworthiness is all about honesty in and out of the workplace. Such is a value some people develop growing up.
sometimes we get go deeply! (i got you)

work ethics at an accounting is all about following a code of conduct which they agreed to follow from hire day. In her perspective, the community often regards them as very honest but it's not the case. 

 I started as a Teller for some Financial institution 10 years back. Honesty was the summary of eighty percent of the points on the code of conduct. 
 A couple of years i start getting approached by a particular co-worker about some fraudulent transaction It only takes someone with a strong work ethic to turn down such offers she continued.  a lot of money involved yet at what cost the sweat of some other person. That's just not the right thing to do irrespective of the situation.

nonetheless, some organizations will just turn you into a different person completely if you are not strong and hold strong honesty values. The bigger the post of responsibility, the bigger the ethic values required 
Being fired by a boss if you won't cover the messy deal he has made with a client is one big factor that brings down values some employees hold. 
  Employees have quit their jobs just to hold these values yet others ended up giving in and losing these.


Generally, we will get along easier at work if we should treat others as mirror images of ourselves and perform our task as though we were the consumers. As such, No one will have to worry about another looking over their shoulders.
